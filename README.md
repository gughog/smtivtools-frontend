[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/361c8415-9820-4eb6-b566-f277a9000ca0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/smtivtools/deploys)

This is the frontend part of this project, that was made with the **PERN** Stack (Postgres, Express, React.js and Node.js).

## About this

> TL:DR - This is an app for searching things related to Shin Megami Tensei IV, as information of skills, apps and creatures from the game.

As a developer, I always seek knowledge to develop my skills and this project consists in 3 parts that have made me gain a lot of knowledge and gaves me passion for working with something that i love that is videogames. See bellow:

1. [A Web Crawler](https://github.com/gughog/smtiv-webscrapper-tool) made with **[Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)** and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) that was responsible for search on internet all data used in this project. And notice that all data and copyrights for this belongs to [Atlus](https://atlus.com/) and they incredible game called **[Shin Megami Tensei IV](https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_IV)**.

2. [A Backend Rest Api](https://github.com/gughog/smtivtools-backend) made with Node.js and Express allied with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), to handle Database. It was deployed in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), which gaves me a Postgres database on cloud too, a great Platform to fast deploy applications (It is limited by 10k rows on free accounts). It was a huge challenge for me to make this (even a single functional route), because I am a frontend developer by default, and this (even if it was not made in the right way) makes me get closer to the goal of become a FullStack developer.

3. [A frontend application](https://github.com/gughog/smtivtools-frontend/) made with React.js, Styled Components, pure CSS and other packages to handle only specific things like load spinners. This frontend app communicates with the rest api by axios calls, and It was super fun to make. This was my first expressive app with React and I had so much fun to do. It has some issues and glitches (I am out of free time, but i am working to handle them), but the main idea is working. This was deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), another great platform to deploy things fast.

Thanks for reading!
